The Roomba implementation consists of 

1. a clean_cell function to clean dirty cell.

2. a forward_rsearch function to let Roomba go forward specific distance. The distance increases as the number of turns increases in a spiral pattern.

3. a left_rsearch function to let Roomba turn left 90 degrees, switch into the next turn in a spiral pattern.

4. two wall_rsearch functions to help Roomba do wall tracing, bouncing, and then back to spiral pattern when it hits a wall ahead. The two functions take different wall tracing length and different number of turns in initial spiral strategy to prevent it from circling in same area.

To run the agent, we need to put the code file under Python ACT-R Library directory and then run the code.
